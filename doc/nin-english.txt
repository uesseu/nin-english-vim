# nin-english-vim
A vim plugin for Japanese person, who has to write English ('A`).  
It is based on EJDict, wonderful english-japanese dictionary.  

This plugin offers
- Ddc based asynchronous completion.
- Or ... Omni Completion based on python(from English to Japanese. Ctr-x Ctr-o)
- English to Japanese Dictionary.
- Installing and Updating Dictionary.
- Syntax highlight of English(It may be useful only for me.)

# Speed
The speed of search is relatively good.  
Because these functions are made by deno or python.  
Especially, speed of deno is good.  

# Dependency
- git
- python3 or deno

In case of python, vim or neovim must be compiled with feature of python.  
In case of deno, denops plugin must be installed.  
(Of cource, it must not be vim-tiny.)  

Git is needed only for downloading dictionary.

# Install
for vimplug

```
Plug 'uesseu/nin-english-vim'
```

for dein
```
call dein#add('uesseu/')
```

And then, you should set 'g:nin_english#dict_dir' and
'g:nin_english#dict_fname'  as global variable in vimrc or init.vim.  
It should be path of dictionary.  

```vim
let g:nin_english#dict_dir = '/home/[user]/.local/share/EJDict'
let g:nin_english#dict_fname = 'dict.txt'
```

# Install dictionary
After you 

# Install dictionary automatically
This command download and construct dictionary from this repo.

```

Thanks to EJDict! It is public domain!  

If you want to install dictionary manually,
this dictionary can be downloaded from here.

# Usage
## Deno based
In case of deno based ui, completion becomes automatic completion.

### Auto Completion
If you use ddc, ddc completes automatically.  
Ddc completes automatically and quickly.  
However, configuration may be difficult a little.  
This example involves vim-lsp and around plugin.  

```vim
call ddc#custom#patch_global('sources', ['vim-lsp', 'around', 'ninenglish'])
call ddc#custom#patch_global('sourceOptions', #{
  \   _: #{
  \     matchers: ['matcher_fuzzy'],
  \     sorters: ['sorter_fuzzy'],
  \     converters: ['converter_fuzzy']
  \   },
  \   around: #{ mark: 'Around'},
  \   ninenglish: #{ mark: 'English',
  \     dict_fname: 'g:nin_english#dict'},
  \   vim-lsp: #{
  \     mark: 'LSP',
  \     forceCompletionPattern: '\w+|\.\w*|:\w*|->\w*' },
  \ })
```

### Search words
I did not set the key bind of hover.  
This function searches the word on cursor.

```vim
call EnglishSearchDeno()
```

And this command makes 'K' hover like function.

```vim
nnoremap <buffer> K :call EnglishSearch()<CR>
```

## Python based
In case of python based ui, you can enable it by typing below at first.  

```vim
EnglishInit
```

### Omni Complete
If you do not use ddc and want to use omni-complete,
you can activate omni-completion by this command.

```vim
:EnglishInit
```

Type as below in insert mode.
```
Ctr-x Ctr-o
```

This is little bit slower and older method than ddc version.

### Search words
Code like below makes 'K' function key to search word.  

```vim
nnoremap <buffer> K :call EnglishSearchPython()<CR>
```

# EJDict format
Perhaps, it may be useful for people in other country,
if there is compatible dictionary.
The dictionary must be TSV format.
EJDict is TSV format like below.

```
[word][tab][mean1; mean2; mean3;...]
```

But I am not sure.  
I am just a Japanese monkey, furthermore am not engineer.
